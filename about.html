    <h1>Hi! I'm Christina.</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a full-stack developer with a background in business operations, a love for logical problem-solving, and a curiosity that refuses to quit. After more than a decade leading teams and streamlining complex processes, I realized I didn't just want to manage systems â€” I wanted to build them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently immersed in an intensive coding bootcamp where I've been learning Java, Spring Boot, HTML/CSS, and full-stack web development fundamentals. While I'm still early in my developer journey, I bring with me a strong foundation in leadership, creative thinking, and the drive to turn ideas into working solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of tech, I'm a writer, DIY enthusiast, and lifelong learner who thrives on meaningful projects and good coffee. Whether it's organizing a workspace or crafting elegant code, I believe clarity, empathy, and precision make everything better.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm excited to collaborate, grow, and eventually work on projects that make people's lives a little easier (and a little more beautiful).
